# immutable-transactions

_immutable-transactions_ is a JavaScript library simplifying transactions in application state where you want to enforce strict immutability while still using native JavaScript objects and arrays.

ItÂ´s a simple and lightweight alternative to Immutable.js or Seamless-Immutable.

Some features:

- If the transaction didn't cause any changes, the previous object will be returned.
- Make operations deep in a nested object using a list of keys, return the top object.
- Supports negative array indexes.

### Example

```javascript
import { changeIn } from 'immutable-transactions'

const state = {
  ultimate: {
    answer: 41
  }
}

const nextState = changeIn(state, ['ultimate', 'answer'], previousValue => previousValue + 1)
// => {
//   ultimate: {
//     answer: 42
//   }
// }
```
